for my cloud nymph ☁️💙  

she moves like a whisper between skies,  
where sunlight blushes to meet her edges.  
the air trembles with heartbeats she gathers —  
tiny, unseen, stitched on threads of dawn.  

when people reach for her,  
she folds herself into mist —  
not from fear,  
but because closeness burns too bright  
for a heart built of morning dew.  

her words come rarely,  
but when they do,  
they land like the first drop of rain —  
soft, certain, and sweeter than the sound of any song.  

she laughs quietly,  
a sound that feels like wind chimes  
lost somewhere in heaven’s pocket.  

and though she never asks for love,  
the world leaves offerings anyway —  
flowers, smiles,  
a thousand gentle thoughts  
scattered in her wake.  

so here’s a little gift for the girl  
who never knew she was the poem.  

made for you, with love, aami 💛
